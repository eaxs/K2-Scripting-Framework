    <p>Welcome to the K2framework compiler. This tool allows you to create your own K2 script file with
    the modules that are currently located in your "modules" folder. Please select one or multiple modules
    from the list below that should go into your script. If no extra modules are selected, you'll only get the core
    features.</p>
